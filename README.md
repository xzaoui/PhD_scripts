# Xavier Zaoui PhD_scripts

Matlab scripts developped during my PhD to analyse fluorescent single-molecule movies
- MAIN_trackDatasets: tracking script
  > segment cell(s) with autofluorescence; 
  > identify fluorescent spots (Gaussian fit); 
  > track over the course of the movie; 
  > compute MSD and Dapp; 
- xav_utils: contains additional functions used in the tracking script
